# COVID-19 Time Series Forecasting

This repository implements **COVID-19 time series forecasting** using advanced techniques inspired by research from the paper [*From data to action: Empowering COVID-19 monitoring and forecasting through advanced analytics*](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01605682.2023.2240354). It includes methods such as **ARIMA**, **BiLSTM**, **GMDH**, **Genetic Algorithm**, and **TSK Fuzzy Logic** for robust and accurate forecasting of pandemic trends.

## ðŸ“Š Methodology

### 1**Forecasting Techniques**
- **ARIMA**:
  - A classical statistical model for forecasting time series data.
  - Best suited for univariate data with stationary patterns.

- **BiLSTM**:
  - Deep learning-based model that captures temporal dependencies in both forward and backward directions.
  - Requires large training datasets for optimal performance.

- **GMDH**:
  - A polynomial regression model with self-organizing capabilities.
  - Automatically selects the best subset of features and model complexity.

- **Genetic Algorithm**:
  - Optimizes regression weights by evolving solutions over generations.
  - Suitable for parameter tuning in complex forecasting models.

- **TSK Fuzzy Logic**:
  - Uses Gaussian membership functions for fuzzification.
  - Implements fuzzy `IF-THEN` rules with linear consequents for robust predictions.
